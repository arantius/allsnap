# History

allSnap was created no later than 2002 and originally supported Windows 95.  It was maintained at least until June of 2010 when version "1.50 beta" was released at [allsnap.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20121009232921/http://www.allsnap.org:80/).

It never gained complete support for Windows 10, but was open sourced [in 2018](https://github.com/iheckman/allsnap/commit/45bd723081091f71659d9ce51223935f4752e446).  This is a fork of that open source release, intended to support Windows 10.
